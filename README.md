The Northwind database is a sample database that has been widely used for educational and demonstration purposes.

The Northwind database models a fictional company called "Northwind Traders," which is a supplier of various food products. The database is designed to simulate a simplified business environment with tables representing different aspects of the company's operations, such as customers, orders, products, suppliers, employees, and more.

Here is a brief description of some of the main tables in the Northwind database:
